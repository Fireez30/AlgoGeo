The installation assumes your system meets some requirements.

Save the archive ibex-2.6.0.tar.gz in some Ibex folder and:

~/Ibex/$ tar xvfz ibex-2.6.0.tar.gz
~/Ibex/$ cd ibex-2.6.0
~/Ibex/ibex-2.6.0/$ ./waf configure
~/Ibex/ibex-2.6.0/$ sudo ./waf install
Windows
Install MinGW+Msys.
Select the following components to be installed:

A MSYS Installation for MinGW Developers
A Basic MinGW Installation
The GNU C++ Compiler
With recent releases of MinGW, you have to run the executable pi.bat in C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\postinstall

Install Python2 (warning: the script are currently not compatible with python3)

Create a new directory Ibex in the shell of MinGW (to open the shell of MinGW, click on Start -> MinGW -> MinGWShell):

mkdir Ibex
Note: if you don’t have MinGW in your Start menu, run the executable file msys.bat in C:\MinGW\msys\1.0.

Assuming you have installed MinGW in C:\, the Ibex directory you have created should be located on your system here:

C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\[user]\Ibex
We will assume now that this folder is the root folder of ibex.

Save the archive ibex-2.6.0.tar.gz in C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\[user]\Ibex

Configure Ibex (still in the shell of MinGW):

~/Ibex/$ export PATH="$PATH:/c/Python27"
~/Ibex/$ tar xvfz ibex-2.6.0.tar.gz
~/Ibex/$ cd ibex-2.6.0
~/Ibex/ibex-2.6.0/$ ./waf configure --prefix=/c/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/[user]/Ibex/ibex-2.6.0
Note: the paths must be entered in Linux-style (don’t use backslash (“\”) as separator).

Install Ibex:

~/Ibex/ibex-2.6.0/$ ./waf install
